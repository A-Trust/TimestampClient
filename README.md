# TimestampClient (RFC3161/5280)

This project is an example C# client for timestamping messages and data according to RFC3161. 

This application uses a Test-Version of the Timestamp Rest API developed by A-Trust. 

# Information

Since a test-certificate is used the produced timestamps cannot be validated for instance in Adobe Acrobat Reader.
